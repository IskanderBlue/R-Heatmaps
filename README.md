# R-Heatmaps

This is the Github repository for https://github.com/minisciencegirl/studyGroup/issues/47. The official event details are as follows:

* Date: September 8, 2015
* Time: 5:30pm
* Room: BCCA (Dorothy Lam Room)

# Preparation for the Workshop

The workshop will contain parts where you can run code to generate some heatmaps. If you are interested in doing this, please bring your laptop to the workshop and git clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:tinyheero/R-Heatmaps.git
```

The repository comes with the following files/folders:

* R-heatmap-slides.pdf: This is the slide deck for the workshop.
* heatmap-cluster.Rmd: This is a Rmarkdown file that contains a tutorial and code on how to generate the images shown in the slide deck
* data: Folder containing the data files required for the `heatmap-cluster.Rmd` file.

Please ensure that you have Rstudio installed. Inside of Rstudio, make sure you install the following R packages:

* dplyr
* knitr
* d3heatmap
* RColorBrewer
* reshape2
* ggplot2

Make sure you can render the `heatmap-cluster.Rmd` file by opening the `heatmap-cluster.Rmd` file in RStudio and then pressing the "Knit HTML" button. If it works, then you should see a separate open window open with a document titled "Generating Heatmaps in R".
